Supply Chain DApp
The purpose of this DApp is to allow a user to track an item via its Stock Keeping Unit (SKU). There are 4 stages in the supply chain, namely ForSale, Sold, Shipped and Received.

This DApp will allow buyers to purchase an item via its SKU and for sellers to receive ether from the sale. It will also emit events so that the front-end JavaScript will be able to update the relevant status of the item. It is a simple Proof-of-Concept.


## Test
To verify that, run `truffle test` to run the test suite.

This assumes you already have the truffle suite installed, if not run npm install -g truffle on your command prompt, set to the directory of this project. If you do not have npm installed, download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/
